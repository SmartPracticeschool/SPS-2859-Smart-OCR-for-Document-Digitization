gardens on the outskirts of Silchar. NIT
Silchar is a teaching and research institute
which reflects in the top NIRF ranking.

ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT

The Department offers B.Tech. in Electrical
Engineering and M.Tech. in two
specializations (i) Power and_ Energy
Systems Engineering and (ii) Control and
Industrial Automation. This department also
offers Ph.D in Electrical Engineering. The
state of art laboratory facilities exist in the
department to train the UG, PG and PhD
scholars to carry research in the frontier
research areas of Electrical Engineering. The
faculty members are specialized in diverse
fields and there is commendable research
ambience in the Department. Department of
Electrical Engineering takes up R & D
projects sponsored by various funding
agencies.

ABOUT THE COURSE

Biotechnology is the field that exploits
living organisms to make technological
advances in various fields for the
sustainable development of mankind. It
has its applications in the medical as
well as agricultural sectors. Some of the
key areas of application are Health,
Biofuels, Bioinformatics, and Industrial
Biotechnology, etc. The Department of

Biotechnology, Govt. of India takes
initiative to enhance _ technological
advances for biological processes

through various research schemes in
the above mentioned fundamental and
applied areas.

This workshop intends to bring experts
from academia and _ industry, and
working in different areas of
biotechnology to deliver the state of the
art researches undertaken in India and
abroad for the sustainable development
and progress of human mankind.

The 5 days’ workshop will enlighten the
young generation of engineers,
researchers of the country to apply their
engineering skills beyond engineering
systems, thereby  inculcating § the
interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary
nature of research.
